## 1st commit

- two local folders running `npm run dev` for the front end
- backend folder `npm start`
- component created, Header, added logo, changed css background color,added component Header to App.jsx

## 2nd commit

- create a `Meals` component
- backend folder to retrieve meal dummy data
- `GET/meals` add a GET request to the meals route
- `fetch()` method used then the `.then()` method to define when that proise resolves to get bacl the `response()`
wrap this data into a separate function, call it `fetchMeals()`. Next set it as an `async` function, as it is a standard funtion inside a component function. Then we move the code to `await` then do a `const` to get the `response` working.
-  `not ok` allowance, add an if statement for errors after that.
- further add a `try` `catch` wrap after async tbc later
- call `Response.json()`
- import `useState` hook with the word use, so that the data gets loaded with the state updates
- add the `Meals` component to `App.js`

## 3rd commit

- create a `MealItem` component
- one meal item per loaded meal
- export a default component funtion to start the file ...
- return the markup in that list of meals
- import a `prop` such as `name`, `price` or `meal` only for all of the  properties via the curly brackets of the `MealItem` function
- Add `MealItem` component to `Meals` with the key `{meal.id}` then `meal` prop set to the `meal` prop in the loop so the data works
